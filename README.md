# gun_blockchain

This is the software prototype for a decentralised firearm registry that also acts as an online firearm market and a gun tracing system.
Run the .sol file in the Remix IDE
The artifact is deployed on the test ethereum blockchain provided by Ganache which belongs to the truffle suite.

Ganche would provide the public addresses each loaded with fake ether. Connect the Remix IDE to the Ganache blockchain using injected WEB3 option in Remix.
This would make the addessses accessible from the Remix interface.

Update the manufacturer, voting entities and the law enforcement in the .sol file by replacing the existing public addresses by new ones that we just obtained from 
the ganache blockchain.
These addresses would then be assigned the privileges corresponding to the entities.

compile the code and deploy he smart contract !!
